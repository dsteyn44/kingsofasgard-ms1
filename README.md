# King of Asgard 

![mock-up](readme-files/mock-up.png)

This is essentially a website for a real nordic melodic death metal band in Sweden call "King of Asgård" - with a bit if a twist. Since most death metal bands are pretty much the same; why should someone listen to their music? What does their music give of value? What besides the music keeps their fans coming back?
In this case I try to answer that with a narrative or storyline of the King of Asgård that comes down and lands on earth to start a death Metal band. He meets the band members in a bar in a small Swedish Town. The site would also include a page called "The Fanwall", which would serve as a social media platform for fans of all kinds of metal music and also fantasy fans perhaps. 
The site would also incorporate a little humour so that it is all not too serious.

The story line would serve both fans of death metal (who would not necessily be fans of fantasy books )and fantasy fans (who would not necessrily be death metal fans).

## Features

I changed the features from the wireframes as they did not work very well with the responsiveness. Also I change the name of the gallery from "My Army" to "Skål" - which is more of a postive thank you to the fans. I left out the page for the narrative or storyline "The Legend" and just added it to the information about the band.

Header

- Band's name: Always on the left-hand side to get the users attention.
- Navigation Bar: Too include links to Home button, The Band page, The Fanwall (with a dropdown menuthat includes links to The Fanwall, ool Stuff and Skål! pages). It must also include a "Contact Us" modal to send simple information to the client. A hamburger styled toggle will be added for small screen sizes so that it will be easier to navigate.

The Footer 

- Links to social media platforms that are related to the product. Must be fixed and visible at all times so that the user can easily get to it. 


Front Page
- Background is menacing picture of the band . Has overflow to give a scroling effect.
- Gig-list includes a call-to-action pop-up modal that will lead the user to a gig-list where they can choose to click on that takes them to a page for purchase. Must be central on the page. Will be moved to icon for mobile devices. 
- Sign-up & win includes a call-to-action pop-up modal that will lead the user to a sign-up sheet. To make it more fun - it will include a question about the band so that the user will go band to the band page. Users can sign up and stand in line to win a guitar.
- A music snippet of the best song to entice peole to listen further and navigate the site. This should be on the lower left hand corner. Altogether all features on the front page will be at a postive gradient to instill a positive feel.

The Band Page
- Information about each band member.
-This will have a little narrative of how the band formed. In the future this will be converted into more of a graphic novel idea.   

The Fanwall
- the header must reflect the page where you are at ie. the color must be different anf the fanwall batton must be white to inform the user that they are here.
- Must have the latest song as a snippet. 
- Overall color must be different to front page so that you can distinguish the difference. 
- Must have a jumbotron with quotes from fans. There must also be a button to add a message to the band. In the future this will be immediate but for now it will be added by marketing.

Cool Stuff
- Must have merchandise for sale that fans can purchase through a click.
- Must be linked to the rest of the website.
- Must have prices on so users can see.
- This will evolve into a store.

Skål Page
- Essentially a gallery with pictures from the band, their travels and fans. 

Fail- page
- This page is to inform the user that they have reached an empass but will be able to safely get back to the home page. There will be a a slightly humourous message.


## Features Left to Implement
- More extensive story or narratiove page or graphic novel page. 
- Add bootstrap tooltips to Sign Up and Gig- lists and navbardrop-downs to give a bit of an explanation with out taking up too much real estate.
- Add a more extensive "twitter" like page, where fans can post.
- Must add music video to fanwall. 
- Cool stuff will eventually become a store.


### Structure:

- Must be able to go where you want to within 3 clicks.
- Utilize "hamburger" bar to allow for more real estate.
- Used more of a linear structure. 
- The use of media queries was used so to remove som eof the information that was probably not all that necessary. for small devices at first.

## Surface

#### Colours

Front page
- Black -  rgba (0, 0, 0, 0.8) this is cliche but pretty much the standard bearer tone. I was using a grey prior but it was too light. For the header and footer I decided to go with with a more transparent overlay so atht athe user can see what is under as a hint.
- Yellow - rgba (224, 172, 26)- this was used for the main text on the front page, the social links, The choice of yellow was a little acccidental. I was using mainly ivory but that was a little too boring for my liking. This yelow is quite reminiscent of the feel of Star Wars. 
- Ivory - I wanted an off white but something warmer. This I thnk works well with the yellow.  

Fanwall page
- Lilac - rgb(135, 140, 175) This was a color on the spotify music audio bar and I used it so that there would be some correlation between the first page and the second.
- Ivory - Just to keep every thing consistent. 

Fail page
- Red - rgb( 231, 65, 24) general warning color and a good color to go with the black. 
- Black (0, 0, 0, 0.8)

#### Typography
- At first I was using Amatic SC with Roboto as second but then I noticed that Amatic was very thin and not easily noticible so I have just opted for Roboto. However in the future this may change for say Shatter for some of the head lines as it gives it a more dramatic effect.
I used a "Water" icon from Font Awesome; however I was actually aiming for something more nordic such as the symbol for Odin. This was a bit difficult to find and in the end I decided to stay with the same. 

#### Images
- Mostly black and white images were used so as to go with the theme of Nordic Noir. To give the feeling of a "murder novel". I tried to source the best images; however I was only able to obtain poor quality images for the mechandise on the "Cool Stuff" Page.

- [FONT AWESOME](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used this for all my icons eg: social links etc. 
- [AFFINITY PHOTO](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) - This a helped me so some mock-ips and for the background images on the fail page.
- [GITHUB](https://gitpod.io/) - IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- [GITPOD](github.com/) - The remote hosting platform.
- [MOUNTAIN GOAT](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/) - This was used to understand user stories.
- PAGES - Apple generic word processing program/application.  
- [W3 SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I Found this very useful for clarification of clearfix  and inline block. 
- [STACK OVERFLOW](https://stackoverflow.com/) - It is gennerally public platform, mainly used for coming up with scripte solutions. 
- [MDZN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Resource tool for developers, by developers. I used this to assist with resizing my images.
- [CHROME DEVELOPER TOOLS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - This was used to test out resposnsiveness and just for general trouble-shooting. Gives you real time feedback.
- [RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - I used this to add to my mock-up for my README.md.
