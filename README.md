# King of Asgard 

This is essentially a website for a real nordic melodic death metal band in Sweden call "King of Asgård" - with a bit if a twist. Since most death metal bands are pretty much the same; why should someone listen to their music? What does their music give of value? What besides the music keeps their fans from coming back.
In this case it is a story of the King of Asgård that comes down and lands on earth to start a death Metal band. He meets the band members in a bar in a small Swedish Town. The site would also include a page called "the fanwall", which would serve as a social media website for fans of all kinds of metal music and also fantasy fans perhaps. 

The story line would serve both fans of death metal (who would not necessily be fans of fantasy books )and fantasy fans (who would not necessrily be death metal fans).

### Surface:
#### Colours

Front page
- Black -  rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8) this is cliche but pretty much the standard bearer tone. I was using a grey prior but it was too light. For the header and foorter I decided to go with with a more transparent overlay so atht athe user can see what is under as a hint.
- Yellow - rgba(224, 172, 26)
- Ivory - I wanted an off white but something warmer. 

Fanwall page
- Lilac - rgb(135, 140, 175) This was a color on the spotify music audio bar and i used it so that there would be some corrolation between the first page and the second.
- Ivory - Just to keep every thing consistent. 

Fail page
- Red - general warning color and a good color to go with the black.
