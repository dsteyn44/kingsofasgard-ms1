# King of Asgard 

This is essentially a website for a real nordic melodic death metal band in Sweden call "King of Asgård" - with a bit if a twist. Since most death metal bands are pretty much the same; why should someone listen to their music? What does their music give of value? What besides the music keeps their fans from coming back.
In this case it is a story of the King of Asgård that comes down and lands on earth to start a death Metal band. He meets the band members in a bar in a small Swedish Town. The site would also include a page called "the fanwall", which would serve as a social media website for fans of all kinds of metal music and also fantasy fans perhaps. 

The story line would serve both fans of death metal (who would not necessily be fans of fantasy books )and fantasy fans (who would not necessrily be death metal fans).

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Content
Most of the text in this site was made up by myself for this project.

I got the menu from an Italian restaurant's website and I just did a few modifications.

I also took Bootstrap's collapsible navbar and modified it for this project.

I took inspiration from W3Schools to make the restaurant's menu a dropdown for better UX on smaller devices.
