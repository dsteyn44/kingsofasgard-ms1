# King of Asgard 

This is essentially a website for a real death metal band in Sweden call "King of Asgård" - with a bit if a twist. Since most death metal bands are pretty much the same; why should someone listen to their music? What does their music give of value? What besides the music keeps their fans from coming back.
In this case it is a story of the King of Asgård that comes down and lands on earth to start a death Metal band. He meets the band members in a bar in a small Swedish Town. The site would also include a page called "the fanwall", which would serve as a social media website for fans of all kinds of metal music and also fantasy fans perhaps. 

The story line would serve both fans of death metal (who would not necessily be fans of fantasy books )and fantasy fans (who would not necessrily be death metal fans). 

 
## UX

 Target market: 
 This website would generally serve fans of fantasy and death metal alike. Ages with following the band would range from 18 years of age to 99. All sexes and persons from cultural backgrounds would be welcome dependent on their tastes. 

Target market: A niche market to start - 18 to 99 years , all sexes, metal-heads, fantasy enthusiasts (those enjoy game of thrones, goths.

### Structure:

se this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.




### Skeleton:

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- What i really wanted to achieve was to have an actual story line that fans be it fantasy or death metal fans could follow on a weekly basis

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
